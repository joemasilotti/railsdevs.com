# Assumptions made
* There was no active styling given for the mobile menu items. I've opted for them to not be full width so that they match the desktop styles
# Fixes needed
* Medium-sized buttons use 12px of padding instead of 16px
* I've increased the spacing between mobile menu items so that the active state is more clear
# Other notes
