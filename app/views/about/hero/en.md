Hi! 👋 I'm [Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com). I'm building `railsdevs` to make it easier for Ruby on Rails developers to find their next gig.

`railsdevs` is being built around three core values:

1. Empowering the independent developer
1. Doing everything in public
1. Creating a safe, inclusive environment
