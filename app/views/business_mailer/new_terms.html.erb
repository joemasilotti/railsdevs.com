<p>Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,</p>

<p>Joe here, founder of <%= link_to "RailsDevs", root_url %>, with two quick updates. You’re receiving this email because you have an active or past subscription.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <%= link_to "terms of use", policies_terms_url %> have been updated.</li>
  <li>There is now an official <%= link_to "hiring agreement", hiring_agreement_terms_url %>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The hiring agreement formalizes the existing 10% fee that customers pay for hiring full-time employees. The amount, collection, and requirements have all remained the same.</p>

<p>If you don’t agree with these terms, please let me know within 7 days and I will cancel your subscription. If you have any questions, you can reply directly to this email.</p>
