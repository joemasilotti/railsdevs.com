Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

Joe here, founder of RailsDevs, with two quick updates. You’re receiving this email because you have an active or past subscription.

1. The terms of use have been updated: <%= policies_terms_url %>
2. There is now an official hiring agreement: <%= hiring_agreement_terms_url %>

The hiring agreement formalizes the existing 10% fee that customers pay for hiring full-time employees. The amount, collection, and requirements have all remained the same.

If you don’t agree with these terms, please let me know within 7 days and I will cancel your subscription. If you have any questions, you can reply directly to this email.
